<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cortical Electrode Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Strip Electrode</li><li>Grid Electrode</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The cortical electrode market consists of two main types: strip electrodes and grid electrodes. Strip electrodes are thin, flexible devices that are placed horizontally along the surface of the brain to record electrical activity from a larger area. On the other hand, grid electrodes are small, square-shaped devices with multiple contact points that are embedded directly onto the brain's surface to capture electrical signals from specific locations. Both types are used in neurophysiological research and clinical applications to study brain function and treat neurological disorders like epilepsy.</p></p>
