<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Implantable Cochlear Implant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Monaural</li><li>Binaural</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The implantable cochlear implant market consists of two main types: monaural and binaural implants. Monaural implants are designed to restore hearing in one ear and are suitable for individuals with single-sided deafness. These implants transmit sound directly to the affected ear. On the other hand, binaural implants are intended for individuals with hearing loss in both ears. These implants provide synchronized stimulation to both ears, enhancing sound perception and localization. Both types of implants aim to improve hearing abilities by bypassing damaged parts of the ear and directly stimulating the auditory nerve.</p></p>
