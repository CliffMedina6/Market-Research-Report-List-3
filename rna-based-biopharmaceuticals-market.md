<p><p>RNA-based biopharmaceuticals are a class of medications that utilize ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules to treat various diseases by intervening at the genetic level. These biopharmaceuticals can be divided into two main categories: RNA interference (RNAi) drugs and mRNA-based drugs.</p><p>RNAi drugs work by silencing or suppressing the activity of specific genes, thereby inhibiting the production of disease-causing proteins. On the other hand, mRNA-based drugs involve the introduction of synthetic mRNA molecules into cells, which are then translated into therapeutic proteins inside the body.</p><p>The RNA-based biopharmaceuticals market is expected to witness significant growth in the coming years. The increasing prevalence of chronic diseases such as cancer, genetic disorders, and infectious diseases is driving the demand for innovative treatment options. RNA-based biopharmaceuticals offer the potential for targeted therapy and personalized medicine, which further fuels their adoption.</p><p>Furthermore, advancements in RNA synthesis and delivery technologies have improved the efficiency and safety profiles of these drugs. This has attracted the attention of pharmaceutical companies and investors, leading to increased research and development activities in the field. The market is also benefiting from favorable government initiatives and regulatory support for the development and commercialization of RNA-based therapies.</p><p>In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the growth of the RNA-based biopharmaceuticals market. mRNA-based vaccines, such as those developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, have demonstrated unprecedented success in combating the virus. This success has boosted confidence in RNA-based technologies and opened up new opportunities for their application in other therapeutic areas.</p><p>Overall, the RNA-based biopharmaceuticals market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.6% during the forecast period. The increasing prevalence of chronic diseases, technological advancements, and the success of mRNA-based vaccines are the key factors driving market growth.</p></p>
