<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical Mechanical Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-invasive Ventilator</li><li>Invasive Ventilator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Medical mechanical ventilators are devices used to support the respiratory system of patients who are unable to breathe on their own. Non-invasive ventilators are designed to deliver oxygen to the lungs through a mask or nasal interface, without the need for intubation. On the other hand, invasive ventilators involve the insertion of a tube into the patient's airway, enabling the delivery of oxygen directly to the lungs. These market types differ in the method of oxygen delivery and are used based on the patient's condition and requirements.</p></p>
