<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive All Wheel Drive Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Automatic AWD Systems</li><li>Manual AWD Systemss</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automatic AWD systems use sensors to detect wheel slippage and automatically engage all four wheels to improve traction. These systems are convenient and require no input from the driver. Manual AWD systems, on the other hand, require the driver to manually engage all four wheels when needed. While manual AWD systems offer more control, they are less convenient than automatic systems. Both types of AWD systems are designed to improve stability, traction, and overall performance in various driving conditions.</p></p>
