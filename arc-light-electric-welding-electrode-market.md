<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Arc Light Electric Welding Electrode Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Consumable Welding Electrode</li><li>Non-consumable Welding Electrode</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Arc Light Electric Welding Electrode market is divided into two main types: Consumable and Non-consumable welding electrodes. Consumable welding electrodes are designed to melt during the welding process, providing both filler material and creating a bond between the two pieces being welded. Non-consumable welding electrodes, on the other hand, do not melt during the welding process and are typically made of tungsten or other similar materials. Both types are crucial in different welding applications and industries.</p></p>
