<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Spacer Fluid Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Viscous Spacer</li><li>Turbulent Spacer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Spacer fluids are commonly used in drilling operations to separate different drilling fluids, prevent mixing, and enhance the performance of drilling fluids. There are two main types of spacer fluids: Viscous Spacers and Turbulent Spacers. Viscous Spacers are thick fluids that create a physical barrier between drilling fluids, while Turbulent Spacers use high-energy flow to create turbulent mixing and prevent fluids from mixing. Both types of spacer fluids play a crucial role in maintaining the stability and efficiency of drilling operations.</p></p>
