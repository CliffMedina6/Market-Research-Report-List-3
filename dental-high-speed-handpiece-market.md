<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dental High-Speed Handpiece Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Inside Exhaust Handpiece</li><li>Outside Exhaust Handpiece</li></ul></p>
<p><p>High-speed dental handpieces are used by dentists for drilling and shaping teeth. There are two types of dental high-speed handpieces based on the exhaust system. Inside exhaust handpieces have a built-in exhaust system within the handpiece itself, removing the air and water from the drilling area. Outside exhaust handpieces have a separate exhaust system attached to the dental unit. These handpieces are connected to a separate external suction device that removes air and water from the drilling area. Both types serve the same purpose but differ in their exhaust system design.</p></p>
