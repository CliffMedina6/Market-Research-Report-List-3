<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Car Microphone Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>ECM Microphone</li><li>MEMS Microphone</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Car Microphone market includes ECM (Electret Condenser Microphone) and MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) Microphones. ECM Microphones use a diaphragm that moves back and forth when sound waves hit it, generating electrical signals. MEMS Microphones, on the other hand, use a tiny membrane that vibrates in response to sound waves, converting the vibrations into electrical signals. Both types of microphones are commonly used in car audio systems for hands-free calling, voice recognition, and other audio applications.</p></p>
