<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Friction Clutch Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Friction Clutch</li><li>Dry Friction Clutch</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automotive friction clutches are classified into two main types: wet friction clutches and dry friction clutches. Wet friction clutches use a lubricating fluid to reduce heat and wear, making them ideal for high-performance vehicles and heavy-duty applications. On the other hand, dry friction clutches do not use any lubricant, making them simpler and more cost-effective for lighter vehicles and everyday use. Both types of clutches play a crucial role in transferring power from the engine to the transmission in automobiles, ensuring smooth and efficient operation.</p></p>
