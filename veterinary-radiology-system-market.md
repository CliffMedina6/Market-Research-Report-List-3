<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Veterinary Radiology System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Digital X-ray System</li><li>Analog X-ray System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The veterinary radiology system market consists of two main types of systems: digital X-ray systems and analog X-ray systems. Digital X-ray systems use digital sensors to capture images, which are then displayed on a computer screen for analysis. This type of system offers advantages such as improved image quality and the ability to easily manipulate and share images. On the other hand, analog X-ray systems use traditional X-ray film and chemical processing techniques to obtain images. Although analog systems are less expensive, they require more time for processing and offer lower image quality compared to digital systems.</p></p>
