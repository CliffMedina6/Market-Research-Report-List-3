<p><strong>What Are The Key Opportunities For Calcium Antagonists Manufacturers?</strong></p>
<p><p>The calcium antagonists market is expected to experience significant growth in the coming years. With increasing cases of hypertension and cardiovascular diseases, the demand for calcium antagonists is rising. These drugs work by blocking the calcium channels in the blood vessel walls, thereby dilating the vessels and reducing blood pressure. Additionally, the growing geriatric population and advancements in drug delivery technologies are further driving market growth. However, patent expirations and the availability of generic alternatives may hamper market growth to some extent. Nevertheless, the expanding patient pool and the introduction of novel calcium antagonists are expected to offer lucrative opportunities for market players in the future.</p></p>
