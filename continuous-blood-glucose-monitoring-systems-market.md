<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Continuous Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-Monitoring Blood Glucose Systems</li><li>Continuous Glucose Monitoring Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Continuous Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems market consists of two types: Self-Monitoring Blood Glucose Systems (SMBG) and Continuous Glucose Monitoring Systems (CGM). SMBG involves using glucose meter devices to measure blood sugar levels at regular intervals. CGM, on the other hand, uses small sensors inserted under the skin to constantly measure glucose levels and provide real-time data. Both systems play a crucial role in managing diabetes, but CGM offers the added advantage of continuous monitoring, allowing for better glucose control and timely intervention.</p></p>
