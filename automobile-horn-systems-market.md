<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automobile Horn Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air Horn</li><li>Electric Horn</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automobile horn systems come in two main types: air horn and electric horn. Air horn systems utilize compressed air to produce a loud and resonant sound, typically found in larger vehicles such as trucks and buses. Electric horn systems, on the other hand, use electromagnetic coils and a diaphragm to create a loud sound when activated. These are commonly found in smaller vehicles like cars and motorcycles. Both types of horn systems serve the same purpose of alerting others on the road in case of emergencies or to avoid accidents.</p></p>
