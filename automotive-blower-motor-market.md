<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Blower Motor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Brushed Motor</li><li>Brushless Motor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automotive blower motors can be classified into two main types: brushed motor and brushless motor. Brushed motors have carbon brushes that deliver power to the motor's commutator, resulting in friction and wear over time. In contrast, brushless motors do not have brushes, leading to less maintenance and longer lifespan. Brushless motors are generally more efficient and offer better performance than brushed motors. Both types have their own advantages and disadvantages, catering to different needs in the automotive industry.</p></p>
