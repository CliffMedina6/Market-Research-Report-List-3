<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The MRI Guided Drug Delivery Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>MRI Guided Drug Delivery Combined with Ultrasound Radiation (Non-invasive)</li><li>MRI Guided Drug Delivery without Ultrasound Radiation (Minimally Invasive)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>MRI Guided Drug Delivery combines the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with ultrasound radiation or without it. In the non-invasive approach, ultrasound radiation is utilized to assist in the delivery of drugs to specific target sites in the body. This method does not involve any surgical procedures and offers a safer and less invasive option. On the other hand, the minimally invasive approach involves MRI guidance alone, without the use of ultrasound radiation. It involves a more localized drug delivery through minimally invasive procedures, providing precise treatment to targeted areas.</p></p>
