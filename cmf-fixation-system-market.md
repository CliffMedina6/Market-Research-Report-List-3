<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CMF Fixation System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable</li><li>Non-absorbable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>CMF Fixation Systems are widely categorized into two main types: Absorbable and Non-absorbable. Absorbable CMF fixation systems dissolve over time within the body, eliminating the need for a second surgery for removal. They are suitable for temporary fixation needs. Non-absorbable CMF fixation systems, on the other hand, remain in the body indefinitely and are often used for permanent fixation of bones and tissues. Both types play crucial roles in orthopedic and maxillofacial surgeries, offering surgeons various options to meet the specific needs of each patient.</p></p>
