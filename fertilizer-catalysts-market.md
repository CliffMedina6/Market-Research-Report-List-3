<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fertilizer Catalysts Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Base Metal Catalysts</li><li>Precious Metal Catalysts</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fertilizer catalysts are categorized into two main types: base metal catalysts and precious metal catalysts. Base metal catalysts are typically made from more abundant and affordable metals such as nickel, cobalt, and iron. They are widely used in fertilizer production processes due to their cost-effectiveness. On the other hand, precious metal catalysts are made from metals like platinum, palladium, and rhodium, which are more expensive but offer higher catalytic activity and efficiency. Both types play a crucial role in enhancing the efficiency and sustainability of fertilizer production.</p></p>
